                            <p>Hello! My name is Ms. Pelagio and I teach US History. This is my 5th year teaching at Trevor Browne and 2nd in The Orange Juice. I love teaching American History because it is the story of how our country came to be. I have also enjoyed the past 2 years in newspaper because it’s allowed me to get to know students in my class outside of that environment.<br><br>Fun Fact: I am also a Trevor Browne graduate.</p>

                            <p>Hello! My name is Brian! :) First thing I would like to mention is that I’m a breed between white and Mexican so I guess you can say Whitexican? I love technology. I been thinking about inventions and thinking of ways to interact with technology itself. Today, I find myself knowing alottttt about technology with sometimes surprising myself with how much I know. I love anime, but I don’t watch too much of it, however, because I like to also stay very productive as I leave my day with a whole schedule put in place.</p>
							<p>I have been in Orange Juice News since December 2019. I am a Junior, and I became the President as I find myself to be able to easily help groups of people. I have helped in making this website with the help of Steven Le. We both know about coding so we have both contributed to making this website. I hope this website gets to go far because we put lots of determination into making it :D.</p>

                            <p>Hey, what’s up! I’m Jair Carrizal, and you’re watching Disney channel. The first thing I would like to say is that I am a mix of Mexican and Philipino. I always had a passion for music, which has made me the odd one out of my family at times. One of the first CDs I ever owned was Drake's <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6agmeioaDOBupymziJihgB?si=Rpi_2OUmRaKFrNOU23AXsw"><i>Thank Me Later</i> album</a>. Sometimes, I find myself writing lyrics randomly, and that's a gift that I just can't explain. I later fell in love with emo rap. One of my favorite artists is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub_Urban_(musician)">Sub Urban</a>. I'm also a big fan of <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Groening">Matt Groening's</a> shows <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons"><i>The Simpsons</i></a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disenchantment_(TV_series)"><i>Disenchanted</i></a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama"><i>Futurama</i></a>. I have probably spent too much time watching all of those shows, but I love the animation in each show.

                                I joined the Orange Juice News in September 2020, and I am a Junior. I originally joined because I liked writing, but things changed. I ended up being an illustrator... wait no an animator. Honestly, I don't know haha. I just draw stuff, so yeah! I ended up drawing the mascot, Ozzie, and I realized that I love drawing; So, now, I’m just working on more drawings and on a couple of articles! :D

I love learning new languages. I currently speak English, Spanish, and a little French. Hopefully, in the future, I will be able to speak many more languages. I love being involved in school clubs and activities as well as traveling, but due to the situation of the world, it has been difficult doing these activities.

							<p>Hi! I'm Minute Maid, The Newspaper Club Mascot!</p>
							<p>I was born in Orange County, California, and I absolutely love anything to do with Orange. That's my favorite word after all! :^ Every since moving from California to Arizona in 2017, I have been trying to acclimate to this new environment. It is a pain, but I am getting through ^__^.</p>
							<p>Ever since growing up, I have always wanted to be a mascot. In college, I studied to become a mascot, and I cannot be happier with any other choice. I love representing for the Orange Juice News :,).</p>
							<p>Here is a list of my favorites!</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Place: Orange County</li>
								<li>Food: Oranges</li>
								<li>Drink: Orange Juice</li>
								<li>News: Orange County Register (Sorry I'm biased hehe)</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Thank you all so much reading our newspapers </p>
