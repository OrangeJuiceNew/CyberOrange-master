								<h3>Netflix Shows to check out</h3>
								<p>As many of us know, quarantine has been a very stressful time. Some of us have all the time in the world, but don’t know what to do. So, here’s a small list of Netflix shows you should binge and why they are listed by genre, duration, and a small description.</p>
								
								<h3>We Bare Bears</h3>
								<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-VFVkRAKL.jpg" style="width: 55%; padding: 0px 50px 50px 50px" class="center">
								<p style="text-align: center" class="photo_caption">Cartoon Network TV Show: We Bare Bears<br><i>Image Credits:</i> Tony Puham: We Bare Bears. July 27, 2015.</p>
                                <p>We Bare Bears is a Cartoon Network TV Show, created by Daniel Chong, that consists of three different bears who live together in San Francisco, California.</p>
								<p>Ice Bear are non-related brothers that have fun and wholesome adventures in every episode. They make friends like Chloe Park, a young introverted Korean girl and a problematic commercial celebrity Nom-Nom, who eventually warms up to them.</p>
								<p>The Netflix version only consists of the first two seasons. Seasons three and four each have over 15 episodes, each running for 11 minutes, and can be watched on Hulu and Cartoon Network. This TV-Y show is a great and not time-consuming series that functions as a source of white noise while doing simple tasks. Or, you can fully binge the life of three wholesome bear brothers and their interactions with their Californian community.</p>
								
								<h3>Las Leyendas</h3>
								<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/las_leyendas_tv_series_732410669_large.jpg" style="width: 55%; padding: 0px 50px 50px 50px" class="center">
								<p style="text-align: center" class="photo_caption">Netflix Original: Las Leyendas<br><i>Image Credits:</i> Ricardo Arnaiz: Las Leyendas. February 2021.</p>
                                <p>The Netflix Original, Las Leyendas, is a TV-Y7 series following the life of a young Mexican boy named Leo San Juan and his three friends: Alebrije, San Andres, and Teodora. These four friends travel all around the world in order to find allies in their battle against Quetzacoatl, an Aztec deity who plans to destroy and renew the world. However, as they travel around the world they introduce urban legends like Baba Yaga, Medusa, Kaijus, and many more.</p>
								<p>The Netflix series is another one of Anima Estudios’, a hispanic animation studio, great works of Leo San Juan. Many Latinos are familiar with their other works like La Leyenda de la Llorona(2011) or La leyenda del Charro Negro(2018). But, this specific series has only one season with 13 episodes, each being 25 minutes long. Not only is it such a fun and educating way to pass time, but for many Latinos, it’s a very nostalgic experience to see the supernatural investigation team back on screens.</p>
								
								<h3>Anne With an E</h3>
								<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThmMzJlNzgtYmY5ZC00MDllLThmZTMtNTRiMjQwNmY0NmRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg" style="width: 55%; padding: 0px 50px 50px 50px" class="center">
								<p style="text-align: center" class="photo_caption">TV Series: Anne With an E<br><i>Image Credits:</i> Anne Wheeler: Anne with an E. March 19, 2017.</p>
                                <p>Anne with an E is a TV series created by Moira Walley-Beckett, that follows the life of Anne, a young Canadian orphan who is adopted by elder siblings, Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, in the 19th century. The show starts off with her figuring out who she is, an outgoing new kid in town with radical ideas, while making life-long friends as well. The series is rated TV-PG, with mentions of serious topics like racism, sexism, sexuality, self-identity, and so much more.</p>
								<p>The series consists of three seasons, with a total of 27 episodes, all being 44 minutes long. However, the first episode of season one is an hour long. This series is one of my top recommendations for those that are in love with cottagecore and environmental visuals, and amazing plot lines as well.It has drama, love, tension, and so much more. Anne has the characteristics of a young activist and poet who sees the world for more than what it is; she is a daydreamer that falls in love with the warm sceneries. It creates a sense of passion and love for the simple things like a nice sunset or a warm pastry.</p>
								
								<h3>Grand Army</h3>
								<img src="http://bancodeseries.tv.br/images/posters/20810.jpg" style="width: 55%; padding: 0px 50px 50px 50px" class="center">
								<p style="text-align: center" class="photo_caption">Netflix Original: Grand Army<br><i>Image Credits:</i> Katie Cappiello: Grand Army. October 16, 2020.</p>
                                <p>This Netflix Original series is a great choice! It is set in modern day New York, at the perspective of five high school students. It mainly focuses on Joey Del Marco and her life. Each student comes from a different background and the show does an amazing job at showing their experiences and differences. The show is rated TV-MA which means that it contains sexual activities, drugs, mental illnesses and trauma, racism, and other sensitive topics. Nonetheless, it does a great job at realistically portraying each aspect.</p>
								<p>Unfortunately, the series only has one season with nine episodes, each being 50-60 minutes long. Fortunately,the 10 hours you’ll spend watching this worth it. Each episode gives exposure to how mental trauma makes people feel and its serious impact, people working day and night to help their low-income families, and figuring out your cultural-identity can be hard.</p>
								
								<h3>Sex Education</h3>
								<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xUlScpmjL._AC_SY741_.jpg" style="width: 55%; padding: 0px 50px 50px 50px" class="center">
								<p style="text-align: center" class="photo_caption">TV Show: Sex Education<br><i>Image Credits:</i> Laurie Nunn: Sex Education. January 11, 2019.</p>
                                <p>Sex Education, by Laurie Nunn, is one of my favorite TV shows. It's based in England and follows the life of high schoolers. It mostly revolves around our protagonists Otis Milburn and Maeve Wiley who created a profitable sex education clinic in their school and come across various different stories, issues, and learn even more about different perspectives. However, with such a mature topic about sex education, the questions of being by yourself, sexuality, homophobia, and trauma are brought into question. It’s a TV-MA show with very explicit graphics.</p>
								<p>The show itself runs for two seasons, each having eight episodes. The timespan for each episode is about 40-60 minutes. It’s an amazing TV show that isn’t afraid to show the passion, beauty, and awakradness of sex education.</p>
								
								<h3>Good Girls</h3>
								<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2b/4b/c7/2b4bc704e0f7729da0bdcb75380de279.jpg" style="width: 55%; padding: 0px 50px 50px 50px" class="center">
								<p style="text-align: center" class="photo_caption">TV Series: Good Girls<br><i>Image Credits:</i> Jenna Bans: Good Girls. Feburary 26, 2018.</p>
								<p>Good Girls is a TV- MA rated show created by Jenna Bans revolving around two sisters and their childhood friend that become criminals and work for a gang leader named Rio. Elizabeth, Annie, and Ruby are day-to-day housewives until they plan to rob a grocery store and accidently mess with a gang’s money laundering business. Over time, they decide to stay and become professional criminals using the money for financial struggles they have in their personal lives.</p>
								<p>The show aired on NBC, but the Netflix version consists of three seasons and has a total of 24 episodes, each running for about 40-60 minutes. One of the best things about this show is the comedic sense that all the characters bring to the table, the soundtrack is an amazing work as well. The plotline complicates itself in such a mysterious and tense way that it creates an intriguing show. Truly a piece to binge watch.</p>
