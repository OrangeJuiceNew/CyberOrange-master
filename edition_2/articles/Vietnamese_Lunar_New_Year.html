								<h3>The Misconception</h3>
								<p>Firstly, Vietnamese Lunar New Year is NOT Chinese Lunar New Year. Although in today’s society, both New Years are relatively similar and are celebrated on the same day, they are not exactly the same. Each Asian New Year is slightly different in its own ways. According to Chúc Bùi, a UCLA lecturer in Vietnamese, “There’s a common misconception that China was the first to celebrate Lunar New Year when Vietnam had already begun observing the holiday over 4,000 years ago. In the next 4,000 years, Vietnam and China would influence each other in their traditions and customs.”</p>
								
								<h3>Background Knowledge</h3>
                                <p>Traditionally, the Vietnamese Lunar New Year occurs on the first new moon of the lunar calendar and ends on the first full moon of the lunar calendar (which takes 15 days to happen). This can occur anywhere between January 21st and February 20th according to the Western calendars. In 2021, this New Year is starting on Friday, February 12, 2021. Vietnamese Lunar New Year has many names such as Spring Festival and Tết Nguyên Đán (which is Sino-Vietnamese for “Feast of the First Morning of the First Day”). However, it is most commonly known by the Vietnamese as “Tết .”</p>
								
								<h3>What are the traditions of Vietnamese Lunar New Year?</h3>
                                <p>The plentiful traditions of Tết can be separated into 3 categories: before Tết, during Tết, and after Tết. Rest assured though, each tradition is just as culturally important than the next.</p>
								
								<h3>Before Tết</h3>
                                <p>Before even celebrating the start of the new year, Vietnamese people around the globe first prepare for this holiday by cleaning their houses and cooking special foods that are common during this special period. For example, a Vietnamese New Year celebration cannot be complete without Bánh Tết, which literally translates to “Tết Cake.” Bánh Tết is a glutenous Vietnamese rice cake that is filled with mung bean and/or pork, wrapped into a cylindrical log with banana leaves, and boiled for 6-8 hours. Another example of unique Vietnamese New Year foods is Canh Khổ Qua Dồn Thịt which translates to “Bitter Melon Stuffed With Meat Soup.” This food is hated by some for its bitterness, but loved by much more.</p>

								<h3>During Tết </h3>
                                <p>The true meaning of Tết is to spend time with loved ones while also hoping for good fortune in the new year. Vietnamese families will bring yummy foods to their relatives, light incense at the shrines of their ancestors, and visit temples to pray to the gods that a good year is upon them. Sometimes, more traditional vietnamese families will dress up in traditional Vietnamese clothing called an “áo dài” which are long silk tunics that have matching headpieces. Last, but certainly not least, we can’t forget about lì xì! Lì xì, commonly known as “red pocket money” are small red envelopes decorated with golden designs of the year’s animal (2021 is the year of the Ox) and given to younger family members as lucky money. This is probably Vietnamese children’s favorite part of the Lunar New Year, but as you get older, you stop receiving money and are expected to start giving it! Oh how the tables turn.</p>

								<h3>After Tết</h3>
                                <p>After 15 days, Tết ends, but festivals and activities still take place. In Vietnam, people participate in buffalo fighting festivals, boat racing, wrestling, and lion or dragon dances. These last for a month after Tết ends. The Vietnamese create invaluable memories here in the New Year, which they will treasure for the rest of their lives.</p>
