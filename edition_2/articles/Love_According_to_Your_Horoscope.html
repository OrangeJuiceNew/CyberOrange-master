How can you tell that they really are the one for you? Whether you believe in astrology or not, it is always fun and exciting to see how compatible your sign is with your significant others. Gathered here are the best, and worst, horoscope couples based on compatibility so look for your sign and see if it is “to be” or “to flee.”</p>

								<p>If you’re an Aries, you are described, by the stars of course, as an extrovert. You love adventure and you’re full of energy. You wouldn’t want anyone to rain on your parade right? Well if so, Cancers are not for you. When it comes to dealing with emotions, Aries tends to be blunt, ruthless if you will, while Cancers are the exact opposite. They are sensitive and emotional. These two signs can clash due to Cancer’s mood swings and Aries’ aggression. So, these two must be kept far from each other. Not to worry though, there is a sign that is very similar to your personality traits: Aquarius! *cue angelic halo music* These two are anything but dull. Together they are creative, competitive, and have excellent communication. Whether you are friends or something more than friends with an Aquarius, you are sure to have a great time with them, regardless.</p>
								
								<h3 id="Taurus">Taurus</h3>
								<img src="http://cdnimage2.caping.co.id/news/20201229/de/1348403159A700A393.jpg_480A0A1A80.webp" style="width: 80%; padding: 0px 50px 50px 50px" class="center">
                                <p>As a Taurus, the bull sign, you are calm and level-headed but also very determined. You know what you want and when you want it. With that being said, say hello to your best friend, Cancer. Both of these signs are nurturers and are very into looking out for each other. They are very simple people and find joy in the quiet, relaxing moments. So all my Taurus people, get yourself a Cancer! Now for the bad part. Taurus’ should steer clear from Aquarius’. Well not completely, pull that car in reverse! When put on the same page, Taurus and Aquarius can do great things, so this is more of a friendship than a relationship. Both have that need to succeed which can help reach a common goal, but both are also extremely opinionated. This trait can bring several arguments even for the slightest things. When they are filled with anger, a Taurus will tackle their anger head on while an Aquarius pulls away, avoiding the situation. This causes a toxic, dominant relationship between the two. You know what, put that car back in drive, hit the gas and don’t look back! Well, not that harsh.</p>
									
								<h3 id="Gemini">Gemini</h3>
								<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1325/0879/articles/headers-zodiac-sign-astrology-personality-positives-negatives-cheat-sheet-gemini_1024x1024.png?v=1517844742" style="width: 80%; padding: 0px 50px 50px 50px" class="center">
                                <p>Ah yes, the twin sign. You are described as valuing love and intelligence over everything. You enjoy a nice, interesting debate with others and you too, have creative, unique thoughts. Listen here Geminis; I might have found your “twin” sign: Libra. These signs match due to their mental agility and value of intellectual interests. Creativity strikes both signs which means the possibilities of hang-out ideas are endless. So run to the store or ask Santa for that special Libra. Now Geminis, you know no one can ruin that spunky, free-minded spirit of yours… except for Virgos. This being that Virgos have a serious mentality and think that life should be all work, no play which is the complete opposite of Geminis. Geminis tend to express their love more openly and in numerous ways but this can be hard for Virgos. Virgos are intimate and they don’t really express their love very well. Both of these factors often cause clashes between Geminis and Virgos, but they say opposites attract right?</p>
								
								<h3 id="Cancer">Cancer</h3>
								<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1325/0879/articles/headers-zodiac-sign-astrology-personality-positives-negatives-cheat-sheet-cancer_1024x1024.png?v=1517625158" style="width: 80%; padding: 0px 50px 50px 50px" class="center">
                                <p>Greetings Cancers of the world! You, the crab sign, are classified as being kind, generous, and caring. You are there for others and are often the shoulder to cry on in your friend group because you love to nurture others. Well Cancers, meet your match: Pisces! Both these signs value kindness and look for happiness. Pisces are very selfless which makes for a great person to have a relationship with. Be careful though, Libras don’t click with Cancers. Reason being that Libras try to see the good in everyone and everything which isn’t good when Libras are put between two people. So, if a Cancer were to get in a conflict with another person, Libras would try to see both sides of a story which would annoy a Cancer. Since Cancers and Libras don’t have big differences, these two can move mountains if they can communicate well.</p>
								
								<h3 id="Leo">Leo</h3>
								<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1325/0879/articles/headers-zodiac-sign-astrology-personality-positives-negatives-cheat-sheet-leo_1024x1024.png?v=1517617612" style="width: 80%; padding: 0px 50px 50px 50px" class="center">
                                <p>Now for the Lion sign, Leo. Leos are the “it” sign; they are the center of attention due to their immense enthusiasm and outgoingness. They provide fun times and are very creative and wild. Basically, anything but boring. What better match for the spunky, unique Leo than a Sagittarius. With these two together, nothing can go wrong because of their similar personalities. Both love to have fun and live life to the fullest. This will bring a relationship with nothing but happiness and respect for each other. Now not everything in life will be sunshine and rainbows, especially when a Leo meets a Scorpio. A relationship with these two will definitely bring some conflicts considering Scorpios tend to be stubborn and dominant mindset. This leads to arguments since Scorpios will not admit their wrongs and will try to control free-spirited Leo.</p>
								
								<h3 id="Virgo">Virgo</h3>
								<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/88/7f/0b/887f0bd5de13acf50dbf377b51b8328f.png" style="width: 80%; padding: 0px 50px 50px 50px" class="center">
                                <p>This earth sign is said to be very critical, picky, and overall serious, but only because they look to help others. They enjoy knowing they are needed and that they are efficient. Characteristics like these are good indications for one sign: Taurus. A relationship between Taurus’ and Virgos is bound to work out since both have a need for being useful. They also both have a very determined mentality which is great when they come together to work towards a common goal. Since both signs are similar, they respect each other and understand each other’s values. So come on you determined sign, look high and low for a Taurus. While on that search for a Taurus, you might want to avoid a Sagittarius. You might be asking why, but it is all quite clear. A serious and perfectionist person, Virgo, does not mesh well with a cheerful, laid-back person, Sagittarius.</p>
								
								<h3 id="Libra">Libra</h3>
								<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1325/0879/articles/headers-zodiac-sign-astrology-personality-positives-negatives-cheat-sheet-libra_1024x1024.png?v=1517444894" style="width: 80%; padding: 0px 50px 50px 50px" class="center">
								<p>Libras are a selfless sign considering they look out for others. They also rarely like being alone so they would never mind some company. Therefore, any sign would be a good match, but the BEST match would be a Gemini. Geminis, too, look out for others and understand them which is essentially a recipe for a good partnership. On the other hand, Libras aren’t the best when matched with a Capricorn. Capricorns are calm, quiet, and they keep to themselves which is different to the social butterfly that is a Libra. Lastly, these two wouldn’t work out due to Capricorns being more like a manager than a partner since Libras are unselfish.</p>

								<h3 id="Scorpio">Scorpio</h3>
								<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1325/0879/articles/headers-zodiac-sign-astrology-personality-positives-negatives-cheat-sheet-scorpio_1024x1024.png?v=1517441497" style="width: 80%; padding: 0px 50px 50px 50px" class="center">
								<p>Scorpios are incredibly curious when it comes to aspects about the world and people they meet. When meeting a new person, Scorpios like to get down business and ask interesting, meaningful questions. Similar to them is Cancer who provides love and care, making them a good match. Scorpios and Cancers click in a relationship because they are both intense when it comes to showing emotions. Both signs enjoy being around others which makes for a strong relationship where both partners understand each other’s values. Of course not every sign will get along great, but especially not Scorpios and Aquarius’. Scorpios are intense and very affectionate when it comes to partners but Aquarius is the opposite. An Aquarius isn’t into emotions which will cause a conflict of interest in the bond.</p>

								<h3 id="Sagittarius">Sagittarius</h3>
								<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EVSDZH7WkAAt1Lx.png" style="width: 80%; padding: 0px 50px 50px 50px" class="center">
								<p>This fire sign is anything but oblivious. They like to get to the bottom of things. They are interested in philosophies and value the aspect of knowledge. Similar to a Sagittarius is none other than an Aries. These two are the definition of a dynamic duo, to others and the world they inhabit, with their enthusiastic and intrigued selves. A strong relationship is sure to happen when a Sagittarius and Aries cross paths. On the contrary, Sagittarius and Pisces don’t have an unbreakable bond like an Aries and Sagittarius do. Pisces tend to be very indecisive so when a Sagittarius is determined to get answers, a Pisces will provide different alternatives which might not always be what their partner wants.</p>

								<h3 id="Capricorn">Capricorn</h3>
								<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1325/0879/articles/headers-zodiac-sign-astrology-personality-positives-negatives-cheat-sheet-capricorn_1024x1024.png?v=1517361013" style="width: 80%; padding: 0px 50px 50px 50px" class="center">
								<p>The tenth zodiac sign, Capricorn, is centered around work 24/7. They are also competitive which makes them work that much harder so they can be the best. Success is what they value most as well as determination and to have goals in one’s life. The perfect partner for these hard-workers are Virgos. Both of these signs enjoy working and strive to be efficient. This will bring the relationship a great deal of respect. Since both signs have very similar values, they will be understanding towards one another. In contrast, a Taurus and Capricorn aren’t the best match. You may be thinking, aren’t they both determined as well? That is true, but they are determined in different aspects. Taurus is determined in love and relationships while a Capricorn focuses on work and career. Capricorns may think that Tauruses are lazy due to their calmness and Tauruses will think Capricorns are too stuck up. All that equals a recipe for disaster.</p>

								<h3 id="Aquarius">Aquarius</h3>
								<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1325/0879/articles/headers-zodiac-sign-astrology-personality-positives-negatives-cheat-sheet-aquarius_1024x1024.png?v=1517258109" style="width: 80%; padding: 0px 50px 50px 50px" class="center">
								<p>The air sign is all about problem solving and changing how things are. Aquarius’ love spending time thinking about how things can be better in the world and in their life. Listen up Aquarius’, if you want to better your life, then find yourself a Gemini. Both signs bond over new ideas and thoughts with their creative, imaginative minds. Because an Aquarius is so full of life, it might be a good idea to avoid a Virgo. Virgos are strictly “work thoughts only” so talking to them about the crazy, brilliant thoughts that go through an Aquarius’ mind might bore or annoy a Virgo. We all know it’s not a good idea to be with someone who you don’t share interests with, so Aquarius’, you know what to do.</p>

								<h3 id="Pisces">Pisces</h3>
								<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1325/0879/articles/headers-zodiac-sign-astrology-personality-positives-negatives-cheat-sheet-pisces_1024x1024.png?v=1517257307" style="width: 80%; padding: 0px 50px 50px 50px" class="center">
								<p>Last but certainly not least is the fish sign, Pisces. As a Pisces, you are described as selfless, happy, and focused on growing as a person. Based on that your ideal partner is a Scorpio who like you is also focused on one’s inner journey. Both of these signs are interested in getting to know each other, forming a strong and stable bond. This Pisces-Scorpio relationship is different from the one a Pisces and Gemini have. These two signs are not the best for each other considering that Gemini often says what is on their mind, sometimes without analyzing first. This could lead to some major and minor conflicts but nothing a Pisces and Gemini can’t solve.</p>
