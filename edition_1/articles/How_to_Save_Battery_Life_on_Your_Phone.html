								<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p class="active">Does your phone always seem to run out of batteries? Well, your problems will be a thing of the past after you implement these ways to save battery life on your phone! After using your phone heavily with tasks that need a few more processes like watching a video or playing games, you start to notice that you lose more battery life. This can be a problem for many as we often use our phone to keep track of what's going on, with things we are connected to such as events with friends or family or with digital work. Of course, the simple solution to this would be bringing the charger with you; however, chargers are portable, but outlets are not. It is usually troublesome to find an outlet. So this leaves us with the following options on how to conserve our battery so that it lasts longer throughout the day.</p>

								<h3>Dark Mode/Brightness</h3>
								<p>	With the new appearance of dark mode coming out for practically every device we use, iPhones, Android phones, and computers. This mode came with the purpose of two cases, to help with usage in the night to help with the comfort of the eyes and to save battery life. However, the big change in battery only comes from phones or computers with OLED screens but has a major effect. As stated by Ifixit, a trusted repair company, “Each OLED pixel generates its own light, while LCD screens light all pixels from the edges. OLED pixels that are black draw no power, and are closer to pitch-black than LCD screens, which draw the same amount of power whether they’re displaying an all-white image or an all-black one.” This really only helps with OLED screens; but what about those with LCD screens which a majority of devices have? Well for those with LCD screens, dark modes won’t help much; however, the brightness does help. The LCD and OLED screens get a huge impact on brightness as it will show less light saving more power for the device.

								<h3>Background Tasks</h3>
                                <p>Phones are known to be able to multitask for a while now, this was made for the user to be able to switch between apps without having to reload the whole app too often. This, however, can cause a problem on its own if you are not planning to use your phone within the next 30 minutes it can cause battery consumption as the whole app will be running in your background taking resources in your phone to use the battery. However, this does not mean that when you close an app you should go and close it completely using the multitasking page. This is a flaw for many as reopening your apps a bunch of times around the same time can end up using more battery than keeping it open for a few minutes.

								<p style="text-align: center" class="photo_caption">iPhone Airplane Mode</p>
								<h3>Airplane Mode/GPS</h3>
                                <p>This sacrifice is only made to be used when you do not need your phone as it does make many features of your phone unusable. Airplane mode will shut off all of your wireless connections such as wifi, Bluetooth, and cellular data. However, the problem with shutting off these toggles is you won’t be able to go online and connect to any Bluetooth accessories while airplane mode is on. In addition, Gps does not get turned off while you turn on airplane mode, the GPS toggle makes it so that your device can send location data that your apps may need. As for all of these settings they use battery life in the background because they need to refresh every couple of seconds to check for any new connections or to send or receive data. Turning on airplane mode and turning off GPS can save you a substantial amount of battery life; however, it is recommended to do this while sleeping or any other times you won’t need your phone.

								<p style="text-align: center" class="photo_caption">iPhone Notifications</p>
								<h3>Reduce Push Notifications</h3>
								<p>Notifications are the little pop-ups at the top of your screen or in your lock screen. These are here to alert you of certain activities within the app; however, this may be a problem as your phone has to refresh and find notifications coming from those apps to send them out to the user. This can use battery life and if turned on you may save yourself an hour or two. The user might have a problem with the need for a certain notification of a number of apps. However, with the newest versions of Windows, IOS, and Android, you have the option to turn off notifications from a certain app. Turning off this setting for a certain app is pretty similar for all devices </p>
								<ol>
									<li>Open settings</li>
									<li>look for the notification setting
									</li>
									<li>look for the app that you don’t need notifications from</li>
									<li>4-tap/click on the app and turn off its notifications access
									</li>
								</ol>
								<br>
								<p>Just like that, you can save battery life by simply turning off possibly annoying alerts that come out of your phone.</p>

								<h3>Conclusion</h3>
								<p>Although batteries might be aging in your phone you can make the most out of it. These tips of tricks of turning off and on settings will surely use less battery life in the phone, resulting in more phone use. Getting the most out of a phone is really important as they are a part of our everyday lives that help us send messages, call and socialize. If your friend is having battery problems with their phone then it might be best to give them a few tricks and tips as well. </p>
